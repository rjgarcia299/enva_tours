My last career path as an entrepreneur exposed me to a variety of operational business models that helped me track employees and communicating with them directly.    
The following project was an inspiration of what kind of programs would be useful to help keep track of employee information but eventually develop future projects such as: 
A customer and sales rep executing a credit card transaction with a mobile program. To create a reservation and be part of a database of trips. 
Inside each trip, there will be assigned a boat with its properties.  
More Ideas to follow. I had the opportunity to be involved in a fastly expanding company that needs to develop for training, accounting, gross sales, and big picture planning.
I like starting from scratch and developing my capabilities with the number of experiences I gained while working with International clients and growing business assets.
